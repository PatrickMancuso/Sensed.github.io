					Sensed: Project Proposal 
Executive Summary
We are making a web app that will serve as a shared collective of people’s stories, associations, and senses related to individual songs. We desire to prompt self-introspection and connection with art and the world just through music. Through learning about how our communities perceive and view music, we can understand the under-researched phenomena of how music, senses, and emotions are intertwined at large.
Introduction
Our team's vision is to create a social catalogue of music and the various experiences users have when listening to it. The experiences can vary drastically from people who claim to see colors, feel emotion, touch, or experience shift within its presence. In order to best capture the various feelings produced with the different music types and songs we decided to create an encompassing, journal-like site to log these experiences. One of the main features we currently most excited to bring to life would be the association of color to songs through selection on a color wheel. This feature will be more specifically tailored to those who deeply connect different colors to different songs. People who claim to experience seeing color and other senses while listening to music are known as synesthetes, and this app could be of special use to them, but also to everyone, whether they have synesthesia or not. In general, the study of how we interconnect different senses with one another is often underresearched, whether it relates to synesthesia or not. Interestingly, scientists declare that “it is estimated that 4 percent of humans have some form of synesthesia”, which poses it at first as a very rare condition (psychologytoday.com). When we look into the details, we discover a different truth: “Unfortunately, the astonishing features of these percepts have too often led the entourage of affected persons, including physicians, to wrongfully consider them as confabulators, drug users, or schizophrenics” (Safran 2014). Several people never discuss their experiences because of feared stigmatization. This combined with a simple unawareness due to never recognizing that they may experience the world differently, the phenomena of intertwined senses is understudied–and we’d like to change that. We are hoping to form a strong community within our app because both synesthetes and general music enjoyers will have the ability to connect and discuss their unique associations, feelings, and stories with one another. 
	Another aspect we hope to create is the ability to log song locations in order to remember where you were when you were enjoying certain albums or artists. Our team believes this would be unique to avid travellers who may fall in love with the local music and can quickly look back at the trip's most popular songs. The advancement of this feature could be expanded into a sort of snap map where the albums are flag-like structure in the location you logged the song. 
	Our team feels there is a market need for apps that allow for the discussion and cataloging of music in unique ways that allow for more than just the chasing of likes other platforms for review like letterboxd can create. It is our team's passion to create something that is truly for the sake of music data collection and the ability to express the motions experienced while listening. Another goal of our teams is to be able analyse and discuss the connections between different songs by way of their most common tags. For example, we would like to find what kind of songs make synesthetes see as “yellow”, and by compiling songs with this tag we will be able to see trends among the genres, artists, or perhaps even words in the title.  
Objectives
	Due to the large scope of our project we plan to have realistic expectations about what we can accomplish on a weekly basis. Our team will follow the timeline we laid out as long as the feedback we receive is positive. The goal is to create a usable, although not entirely created, web-app that allows users to document their emotions about music. Starting with the collection of data through surveys we will gather an idea of what CU Boulder students are looking for in an app like this. To ensure the surveys are and remain relevant we have read articles posted by the Interaction Design Foundation “Define your target audience and goals before you write any questions—and don’t have any generic questions that don’t relate to the product or service when you do get writing them” (Soegaard, 2023). Through the coding of these surveys and eventual interviews we will utilize class time and outside class time to unanimously decide the must haves and not needs of the app. Once this is completed we will begin to code the features into existence while simultaneously updating the look of the overall design per any user feedback. While the scope of the full app is beyond this semester, our timeline positions us to showcase a working prototype that can be further developed in the future. 

Scope
While we are extremely ambitious with this project, it is realistic to identify our boundaries and limitations. To be clear, our main focus is to create the most viable product we can within the given semester. The objective is to build a functional prototype or demo version, instead of a fully developed product/platform. The interface design will be simpler and streamlined than our competition and existing platforms. We are prioritizing usability, and demonstrating our concept effectively rather than trying to be overly flashy or mimicking large scale platforms.  In the words of Dieter Rams, “Good design is as little as possible. Less, but better, because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.” (Dieter Rams, Less, but Better, n.p.)  Our app may not have the same scale of interactive media (i.e animations, comment systems, upvotes), but will integrate small scale interactive features such as story  prompts that tag prompts such as memory, senses, and emotion. Users will be able to scroll through the shared experiences, as this will demonstrate our concept without the technical overload.
Our web application will not include a music streaming feature similar to Spotify and Apple Music. Streaming music requires agreements and licensing with record labels and artists. The music industry itself acknowledges how expensive licensing is. As Sajdak notes in ‘Streaming Music Industry Challenges’: “One of the significant streaming music industry challenges is the rising costs associated with licensing agreements, which raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of current business models” (Sajdak).  These licenses do cost millions of dollars annually, making it a bit hard and daunting for a student-led project. Although this feature would help strengthen the app in the future, we do not currently have the resources or time at the moment to add it. Given our timeline, we are focusing on creating a minimal functional product rather than trying to add extra features. Instead, we are focusing on functionality and creating an app that highlights the core aspect of our idea: creating a shared space for music listeners to share personal stories, senses, and emotions. 
This project is also limited to the size and reach of our community. This is an in-class project so our engagement is limited to our peers, responders of our surveys, and small test groups rather than a global audience. Our testing pool won't fully represent a broad music community. Although this reduces the overall scale of results, it allows us to gather meaningful feedback that helps us refine our design before even thinking how it can grow in the future. We do not see this as a weakness, but an opportunity to stay grounded in our core vision of what we want the app to be: building a space that demonstrates the core value of connecting people through their personal relationships with the music they listen to. 

Methodology and Approach
Our methodology and approach will consist of talking to people, then building, testing, and refining. We will do surveys and interviews with classmates and people around us to see how they connect with their music whether it's through memories, colors, places, or other things. We will then record their responses into themes and let that be our guide for what features we actually design. From there we will create wireframes and prototypes with figma to test the flow before coding anything. 
Once we feel good about the design, we will build out a simple web app using HTML, CSS, and Java using some sort of API or database. After the first version is working and we put it through user stress tests, we will collect feedback from users and make changes before another round of testing. By applying this method, we think that we will end up with something functional that actually reflects how people want to share their experience with music. 
Team
Our team consists of five members, Emelia, Inaki, Luke, Nathaniel, Patrick who each have experience in a wide variety of visualization tools and coding languages. 
Luke is a team oriented and dead line driven teammate who is willing to do whatever it takes for the best product possible. In pursuit of his Information Science degree Luke decided to focus strongly on data visualization tools like Tableau, PowerBI, and arcGIS to display the best possible graphics. In order to benefit this team I plan to use my acquired skills within the previously listed tools to assist in the development and cleaning of our products final design. Along with this, I plan to work with those in our group who have more experience with web building, and help them with what is needed to create our deliverable. I also plan to utilize my experience in python to pull from APIs, specifically LastFM, in order to have a huge amount of songs and their information ready to access.
Emelia is highly determined to produce projects that benefit and challenge people to think in a new light, interested in topics of art and sociology. She is people-oriented, and thrives in detailed discussion, user-testing, and problem solving on the UX side of things (including sketches, prototyping). Her capabilities extend further to programming aspects as well, most primarily data visualization with altair libraries in Python, but also include larger handling and cleaning. She is currently in a Web Design class and plans to contribute to the building of the web-app as well, and would love to let this project be an opportunity to build this skillset with web-design, css, javascript, etc. She is very attentive to detail and will make sure this project will live up to our goals, and is excited to produce something completely deviates from your average music-analysis web-app  experience.
Inaki is bringing a mix of design and coding to the group. He will be focusing on building out the figma prototypes that will help sha[e the look and flow of our web app. Making sure the design stays clean, usable and true to our vision. Along with that, he plans to contribute on the coding side for the web app while we move from wireframes to working demos. His goal is to help combine the gap between design and development so that what we sketch out in FIgma translates smoothly into the actual app. He is excited to make sure the project is functional and visually appealing.
      Patrick has a lengthy history of web design and graphical design. His biggest strengths are quick thinking and problem solving. This has been cultivated through years of strengthening coding knowledge and pursuing ethical design. His primary focus for this project will be drafting the core designs for the site and delivering upon those designs via web coding. On top of that he plans to help significantly in the core ideas for the website such as the features, concepts, and overall esthetic accomplished. This will also be done through substantial web coding and graphical expertise.
	Nathanael brings a balance of research, analysis, and vision. His focus is primarily on making sure the project is aligned with the larger goals while also contributing to the technical side. His background in data visualization and experience with Python, SQL, along with presenting data will help build out features that connect users stories to the music they care about. Nathanael also brings strong concepts of development and communication, helping frame creative and clear ideas that help bridge design with functionality.  
Deliverables
What we’re aiming to deliver is a simple prototype that works as a small archive of songs and the experiences tied to them. In a way, it feels closer to the early days of the web, when sites were built to share personal stories and experiments rather than to chase scale. Patrick has a strong history of web design, which he will implement with HTML, CSS, and JS experience. Our demo won’t be overloaded with features, but it will show the heart of the idea: a place where people can log a song and connect it with a color, a memory, or a place, then see what others have shared. It’s less about polish and more about capturing that sense of connection, the kind that made the web meaningful in the first place. 

Conclusion
At its core, this project is about holding onto the small, personal ways music moves people and giving them a place to live together. The app is a step toward that. A very simple idea, imperfect, but built around connection. Just as the early web gave space for people to share pieces of themselves, we see this project as continuing that tradition, using music as the thread. Even if it begins only in our classroom, it shows something worth returning to.
